<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Handling only a single action at a time is quite limited, so let's improve the program to handle multiple actions, one after another. The program should repeatedly ask a user what they want to do. If the user types <code class="java">"buy"</code>, <code class="java">"fill"</code> or <code class="java">"take"</code>, then the program should behave exactly as it did in the previous stage. But unlike the previous stage, where the state of the coffee machine was displayed before and after each action (<code class="java">"buy"</code>, <code class="java">"fill"</code> or <code class="java">"take"</code>), the state of the coffee machine should now be shown only when the user types <code class="java">"remaining"</code>. Additionally, if the user wants to switch off the coffee machine, they should type <code class="java">"exit"</code> to stop the program. In total, the program should now five actions: <code class="java">"buy"</code>, <code class="java">"fill"</code>, <code class="java">"take"</code>, <code class="java">"remaining"</code>, and <code class="java">"exit"</code>.</p>
<p>Remember, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a cup of <strong>espresso</strong>, the coffee machine needs <em>250 ml</em> of water and <em>16 g</em> of coffee beans. It costs <em>$4</em>.</li>
<li>For a <strong>latte</strong>, the coffee machine needs <em>350 ml</em> of water, <em>75 ml</em> of milk, and <em>20 g</em> of coffee beans. It costs <em>$7</em>.</li>
<li>And for a <strong>cappuccino</strong>, the coffee machine needs <em>200 ml</em> of water, <em>100 ml</em> of milk, and <em>12 g</em> of coffee beans. It costs <em>$6</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Write a program that continuously processes user actions until the <code class="java">"exit"</code> command is given. Additionally, introduce two new options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">"remaining"</code>: to display the current state of the coffee machine</li>
<li><code class="java">"exit"</code>: to switch off the coffee machine</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, the coffee machine can run out of resources. If it doesn't have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee and indicate which resource is missing.</p>
<p>And the last improvement to the program in this stage â€” if the user types <code class="java">"buy"</code> to buy a cup of coffee but then changes their mind, they should be able to type <code class="java">"back"</code> to return into the main menu.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>Your coffee machine should start with the same initial resources: <em>400 ml</em> of water, <em>540 ml</em> of milk, <em>120 g</em> of coffee beans, <em>9</em> disposable cups, <em>$550</em> in cash.</li>
<li>The program should loop indefinitely, processing actions until the user types <code class="java">"exit"</code> to switch off the coffee machine.</li></ol></div>
